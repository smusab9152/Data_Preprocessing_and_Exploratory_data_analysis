Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate different techniques for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

The notebooks cover a wide range of tasks commonly performed in a data science workflow — from cleaning and transforming raw datasets to building and evaluating machine learning models.

| Notebook                                             | Description                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`Classification_and_prediction_regression.ipynb`** | Builds classification and regression models, evaluates predictive performance.               |
| **`Data_Aggregation.ipynb`**                         | Demonstrates grouping, summarizing, and aggregating datasets.                                |
| **`Data_Transformation.ipynb`**                      | Shows how to transform raw data (scaling, normalization, handling missing values, encoding). |
| **`Feature_Selection.ipynb`**                        | Implements techniques for selecting the most relevant features.                              |
| **`Feature_Transformation.ipynb`**                   | Feature engineering and transformations (e.g., encoding, PCA).                               |
| **`Handle_Imbalanced_Classes.ipynb`**                | Methods to deal with imbalanced datasets (oversampling, undersampling, SMOTE).               |
| **`Market_Basket_Analysis.ipynb`**                   | Association rule mining and frequent itemset analysis.                                       |
| **`PCA_Data_Mine.ipynb`**                            | Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.                             |
| **`Webscrapping.ipynb`**                             | Collecting datasets via web scraping (typo in filename: should be *Webscraping*).            |
