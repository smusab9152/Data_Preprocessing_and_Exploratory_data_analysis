Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate different techniques for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

The notebooks cover a wide range of tasks commonly performed in a data science workflow â€” from cleaning and transforming raw datasets to building and evaluating machine learning models.
